Dog goes ""woof"", cat goes ""meow""
Bird goes ""tweet"" and mouse goes ""squeak""
Cow goes ""moo"", frog goes ""croak""
And the elephant goes ""toot""

Ducks say ""quack"" and fish go ""blub""
And the seal goes ""ow ow ow""
But there's one sound that no one knows

[Verse 2: Vegard]
Big blue eyes, pointy nose
Chasing mice and digging holes
Tiny paws up the hill
Suddenly you're standing still

[Pre-Chorus: Bård & Vegard, Bård]
Your fur is red, so beautiful
Like an angel in disguise
But if you meet a friendly horse
Will you communicate by
Mo-o-o-o-orse?
Mo-o-o-o-orse?

How will you speak to that
Ho-o-o-o-orse?

[Bridge: Vegard & Bård]
The secret of the fox, ancient mystery
Somewhere deep in the woods
I know you're hiding
What is your sound? Will we ever know?
Will always be a mystery
What do you say?

[Outro: Bård, Vegard]
You're my guardian angel hiding in the woods
What is your sound?

Wadu-aidu-wadaidu...

[Verse 1]
There is a song, you're tremblin' to its tune
At the request of the moon
Lickin' her chops, she looks at the lunatics
She needs another fix

[Chorus]
I'm only jokin', I don't believe a thing I've said

And we really came from Mars

And heavenly bodies make us fight

Are you lonesome tonight? Do you miss me tonight?
Are you sorry we drifted apart?
Does your memory stray to a brighter summer day
When I kissed you and called you sweetheart?

[Verse 2]
Do the chairs in your parlor seem empty and bare?
Do you gaze at your doorstep and picture me there?
Is your heart filled with pain? Shall I come back again?
Tell me, dear, are you lonesome tonight?

[Interlude]
I wonder if you are lonesome tonight
You know someone said that the world's a stage, and each must play a part
Fate had me playing in love with you as my sweetheart
Act one was where we met
I loved you at first glance
You read your lines so cleverly and never missed a cue
Then came act two
You seemed to change, you acted strange
And why I've never known
Honey, you lied when you said you loved me
And I had no cause to doubt you
But I'd rather go on hearing your lies
Than to go on living without you
Now the stage is bare, and I'm standing there
With emptiness all around
And if you won't come back to me
Then they can bring the curtain down


[Outro]
Is your heart filled with pain? Shall I come back again?
Tell me, dear, are you lonesome tonight?"

[Verse 1]
I only wanted to have fun
Learning to fly, learning to run
I let my heart decide the way
When I was young

Deep down, I must have always known
That this would be inevitable
To earn my stripes, I'd have to pay
And bare my soul

[Chorus]
I know I'm not the only one
Who regrets the things they've done
Sometimes, I just feel it's only me
Who can't stand the reflection that they see
I wish I could live a little more
Look up to the sky, not just the floor
I feel like my life is flashing by
And all I can do is watch and cry

I miss the air, I miss my friends
I miss my mother, I miss it when
Life was a party to be thrown
But that was a million years ago


[Verse 2]
When I walk around all of the streets
Where I grew up and found my feet
They can't look me in the eye
It's like they're scared of me

I try to think of things to say
Like a joke or a memory
But they don't recognize me now
In the light of day

[Chorus]
I know I'm not the only one
Who regrets the things they've done
Sometimes, I just feel it's only me
Who never became who they thought they'd be
I wish I could live a little more
Look up to the sky, not just the floor
I feel like my life is flashing by
And all I can do is watch and cry

I miss the air, I miss my friends
I miss my mother, I miss it when
Life was a party to be thrown
But that was a million years ago
[Outro]

I don't want to wonder if this is a blunder

You used to get it in your fishnets
Now you only get it in your night dress
Discarded all the naughty nights for niceness
Landed in a very common crisis
Everything's in order in a black hole
Nothing seems as pretty as the past though
That Bloody Mary's lacking in Tabasco
Remember when you used to be a rascal?

[Chorus]
Oh, the boy's a slag, the best you ever had
The best you ever had is just a memory
And those dreams weren't as daft as they seem
As daft as they seem, my love, when you dream them up

[Verse 2]
Flicking through a little book of sex tips
Remember when the boys were all electric?
And now, when she's told she's gonna get it
I'm guessing that she'd rather just forget it
Clinging to not getting sentimental
Said she wasn't going but she went still
Likes her gentlemen not to be gentle
Was it a Mecca Dauber or a betting pencil?


[Chorus]
Oh, the boy's a slag, the best you ever had
The best you ever had is just a memory
And those dreams weren't as daft as they seem
Not as daft as they seem, my love, when you dream them up

Oh, Flo, where did you go?
Where did you go? Where did you go?

Slaughtered in that masquerade

Put my body on display in the parade
Passing slowly through the town
My feet, they cannot touch the ground of the parade

Bury me in different shades of the parade

Never leave this, never leave this town of the parade

Girl, this motherfucker's got rhythm

[Verse 1: Phife Dawg]
Say am I 'posed to be dead or doin' life in prison?
Just another dummy caught up in the system
Unruly hooligan who belongs in Spofford
Verse getting that degree at Stanford or Harvard
Threatened by my work ethic, the way I speak, yo
Should I be mentally weak, verse being Malik? Yo
Should I be trapped in the trap? Would you prefer that?
Fourth grade reading level but he knows how to rap
Are you amused by our struggles? The English that's broken?
The weed that I'm smokin'? The guns that I'm totin'?
The drugs that I'm sellin'? No need for improvement
Fuck you and who you think I should be, forward movement

[Verse 2: Jarobi]
Melanated shrouded in complexity
Brain charge shocking like 'lectricity
Mouth translate happens organically
The media relates it what it thinks it sees
Judging steps in shoes of a path they never walked
Shot down in a blaze of a phrases is how they talk
Dark skinned, walk with a bot portrayed villain
I'm chillin', felon down to the DNA crime willin'
Subliminate their youth, hyper-sexualize their women
They ain't got the strong enough hold, so they built the prisons
Pumping false religions to all of these niggas' systems
Every voice devoid of the truth
Come on, listen


[Verse 3: Q-Tip]
Man look at this, man look at this
Whatever will be will be
Like a billionaire investin' in a nigga's dreams
Certainly a head scratcher, like Pac and Big's killers' capture
Or a women with the wisdom who's leadin' the way
The rarity is in the rear, but never today
Man, picture a PD lettin' good records play
On the strength of what it is, not the finesse of your biz
And your lady calls you dirty, her dirts under rugs
You'll find out only if she tells you, take her kiss and hug, cuz
In the answer for cancer in a prodigious kid's mind
Yes, the government will fund, learning is free for everyone
And from that lie, young leaders will rise
In the eyes of despair and adversity
In some universe, this verse will be true

[Hook: Q-Tip]
Everybody runnin' when they see the storm's comin'
But whatever's gonna be will be
Everybody runnin' when they see the storm's comin'
But whatever's gonna be will be
Some will dash to the mountain, some will crawl
And the weakest amongst them, they will fall
But the strongest in faith, they will stand tall
Everybody runnin' when they see the storm's comin'
But whatever's gonna be will be


[Verse 4: Consequence]
I just wanna feel as liberated as lions in Liberia
'Cause recently my heart turned cold as Siberia
'Cause everywhere I go, bein' cold is the criteria
Let's see how well you know all your Tribe trivia
Green and the white, we servin' that Nigeria
North side of Queens, one-nine-two is the area
This is for my dawgs from Shih Tzus to Terriers
Fuck it, it's showtime, Tip, make sure they hearing you"

Don’t let it be you, man up my youth
Phife, you should've spoke of, man you'rein the mode of
Leave that to me, el-Hajj Malik

Like Marauders on a mission when we killin' dance halls
Mmm, Saga boy, Trini man
Ride out when mic is in mi hand
Loved all of mi fans, one, two, three of dem all of the gang

With a couple pound a weed and a couple dollar van
Hmm, broke pockets, find another plan
Yeah, cyan dun, push up on the one
And big up the sound man, dibby dibby DJ walk
Ayo Bus with them a talk
They don’t want no prob, they don’t want no issue
Outline them in bloodclaat chalk
Earlier in the night when we bring out the music
With a box and a band killer sound boy movement
Live and direct when it all goes down
You an idiot boy, you don't wanna fuck round
Big tune make the world go round
Make way for the sound boy crown
Don't you know we're the wickedest sound
One box off in your face make a sound boy frown

Handle rocks with the capital G, ball on the beat
Status, Chris Paul and John Wall in the league
Grabbin' mics till the knuckles would bleed
('Cause I believe
The potent that I'm quoting will have you geeked like speed)
If rationale is naturale or a weave
It's all edges and peas
Settin' press, we on a permanent steeze
I'm in a world where my princess is Leia
And she's feeling my Vader
And my lure grows greater and greater
Chem trails, droppin' poisonous vapors
Have you shaking like Gator
Been trill, nigga, process the data
Blu-ray, wave file, or a Beta, I'll DVR it for later
Kappo Masa with a G to my waiter
You can't define us, XY us, or Z us
You generational elitists
Have your chi in virtual think pieces
(See, these written words are poetical science
Brain's defiant, thoughts heavy, baby
They're a major appliance)Leave a dent when drop with the flyness, fluent giant
Dude's nice, he tight, screwed in with some pliers
Cool with some buyers
Yeah, nigga, cool with some growers
(Never no tattletales, only I don't knowers)
We a show me generation, show us what you gon' show us
So listen, mami, see we could collude with a boing
Mouthpiece like Goines, with a jubilant noise
Dudes rude and as useless as coins, shoot 'em boys
Versed in, rehearsed in the soothing of loins
Talk to Joey, Earl, Kendrick, and Cole, gatekeepers of flow
They are extensions of instinctual soulIt's the highest in commodity grade
And you could get it today

One hitting reading pages of Poe
Telly is low, cuddle bunny ready to go
Day of the dead
Bury all the zombies instead
And it's just your aftermath, Busta cuttin' your dreads
Bruce Leein' niggas, while you niggas UFC
Smoke tree on niggas, sizzle out your USB
(Surge pricing on these Ubers, I'mma get me a cab)
Yo, where Jarobi at?
Imbibing on impeccable grass
I be in NYC waiting for that law to pass
(Pass shit, been waiting for a Jet's title since last
Richard Todd, Todd Bowles, gang green on that ass)
Magic Mike on the mic, David Blaine, Douglass Henning
In the church of Busta Rhymes, it's my sermon you're getting
Horizontal spittin', I'm the exorcist of your writtens
Don't interrupt me, nigga, sorry, that's a sin unforgivenLike how we be skipping on beats like cooking crack in the kitchen
B-b-b-b-b-b-but wait
Just spit the package, dry it, bag up the wet
This mad city's not a game, easy, quiet on set, Phife
(Student of the past trailblazing a daze
Not acknowledging a trend or swept up in a phase
We still the highest of commodity grade
And you could get it, get it, get it, get it today)

Yo, I'm savant with the game
Gon' tell Robi yo' name
Provide words that's heard, setting your body aflame
Ooh, you off the chain, I'm handling your terrain
Your valley h-has me standing down to the follicle
'Bout half of this bottle full of reasons for us to ball
Palming violations and travel vacation, ma
Lace your fancy bra, gon' take them vestments off

Is it an issue if I make you nut?
But there's no quality time 'cause I forever grind
This is not an excuse, I just wanna get loose
That's old nigga jargon, girl, you're making me hardened
To a stone or granite statue, I'm prone to get at you
It's hard to break your defense, I guess I have to leap fence
Or scale wall, and break fall on a tree right by your window
Reward me for my efforts by rolling this indo
As I nibble your neck naughtily, sex is a big part of me
Agencies want to audit me, searching, snooping for sodomy
My thrust bust artery, I know you're on to me
Just wanna have shenanigan
Don't wanna make you mad again
So focus on the flattery you feel when I fling it
Acknowledge that I got it and you love it when I bring it
Dirty talk loud but they saying, ""Fuck the shit out of me""
At the Queen's request, if it's gotta be, it's gotta be

I break bread, ribs, hundred dollar bills
Dream about Bugattis and other four-wheels
They say Illuminati and other ordeals
Is how my lawyer got me to avoid a raw deal
And now it's more real than it is for any other star
And that's enough to have you tearing up the mini-bar
I should probably get awards where the Emmys are
For how I deal with the pap like Remy Ma
I get in the car like a sniper's on the roof now
But don't confuse how you see me have to move now
I got bars like a cypher's in the booth now
Ooh, child, things are gonna get easier
'Long as they get my page right on Wikipedia
'Long as they say my name right in the media
If you don't, that's a sin like Cincinnati
'Cause ever since I had the polo suit at the Grammys
I been spittin' at the camera like Trick Daddy
So swaggy, he could've broke up with IG
I ain't surprised that they broke up on IG
I got the game on IV, might as well have a live feed
Keep a fresh cut from IB
So I always match the picture in my ID
They packin' Dub C had ran with Mack 10
I was still a baby Similac then
And what the crack era did to black men
It had to be an error if you had a Cadillac then


[Verse 2: Busta Rhymes]
How I rock mine, I throw it up
Makin' sure that you niggas all are on the same page
Powerful force, you better look both ways
Fuck that, I'm chokin' niggas, it's goin' down
I'm from a different cloth, we the oracles of the sounds
Skip town, hit 'em with impeccable pound
Lost, found, the way I flood it, niggas gon' drown
Rip shit—ayo, wait, wait, wait, wait—
I gotta do it again, I gotta do it again
You already know the script, roundhouse kick
She lookin' at me, lickin' her lip
Put my arm around her like a bowl of chip with a dip
With yo' bitch, what the fuck, niggas erupt
I got the half moon clip, that's banana
A good planner, a new anger like a larger Bruce Banner
Out the house, nigga, if you open your mouth
Man, nigga, if you open your mouth
Fuck the press, I'm leavin' every room in a mess
Like herds of bulls with they aprons on and bakin' soda
Keep it movin', keep the convo short
And bring a case of Henney (case of Henney)
House of pain, I control many (control many)
House of lies, you niggas go run, hide
Peep the way this vibe conflict with they real lives
(Nigga) Fanatic shit, we go bizarre (we go bizarre)
Bad news for niggas as I go emphatical, radical
National animal rulin' like a czar
Every time I black for the record, the shit splatter

And don’t be taking slack from these non-rapping niggas, man

Especially when you see 'em at the lobby of a label
And they don’t seem able to outstretch they hands
And admit they fans
You better flame 'em in the J's that they standing in
Ostracize they memory for not remembering
The articles reduce their body parts to particles
And dust the Dead Sea with their cremated molecules
I’m leaving, but nigga you still got the work to do
I expect the best from you, I’m watching from my heaven view
Don’t disappoint me, make sure that they anoint me
As the blue ribbon pedigree, the best of show, five-foot-three
Speak of the legacy for short people around the world
Napoleonic, bionic people who cause the world to twirl
Rip every stage with grace, look right dead in they face
Live the Tribe principle of havin' impeccable taste
Enjoy that breath like that one was your last one left

I hope my legendary style of rap lives on
A-fixed to the Earth like my feet, they got cleats on
I'm moving backwards, never that was never the plan
Pushing shit along, render stillness in the quick sand
Asphalt jumpin', junkie lyrical, concrete
My Jedi mind be moving me
Throughout the many dark streets
Backwoods, boondocks, whatever terrain
Auf Wiedersehen, Aloha, man our feet ain't the same
I won't abuse these shoes, these shoes ain't made for reversing
Then trudging through these motherfuckers' first album Footprinting, never ever ghostwritten, yo' shit free, bitten
Grab my shit with both hands, iron grip, steel mitten
Bloviated, Jarobi ate it and now it's gone
Closed mouths don't get fed or move ahead
To my hustlers with customers, scam my chicks just being petty
Trap lords with the fetty, don't be no backwards, no
No backward ass nigga, don't be no backwards, no
No backward ass nigga, don't be no backwards, no
No backward ass nigga, don't be no backwards, no
Don't do it, nigga

When I stopped, I felt lost

Maybe the answer's not out there
Maybe it's on the ground somewhere

Think I'm moving, I ain't going nowhere, nowhere
Maybe why I feel lost, yeah

And again I feel lost
Was not a cruise that brought us here, again I feel lost

How demeaning, y'all? Who could be blind to racism?
Bring bro bro to me for the brotherly baptism
Instead of slaps, give him the dose of Ab wisdom

Weather man said, ""It's gonna snow""
By now I should be used to the cold

[Verse 1]
Mid-February shouldn't be so scary
It was only December
I still remember
The presents, the tree, you and me

[Chorus]
But you went away
How dare you?
I miss you
They say I'll be OK
But I'm not going to
Ever get over you

[Verse 2]
Livin' alone, here in this place
I think of you, and I'm not afraid
Your favorite records make me feel better
'Cause you sing along
With every song
I know you didn't mean to give them to me


[Chorus]
But you went away
How dare you?
I miss you
They say I'll be OK
But I'm not going to
Ever get over you

When I see it in stone

Mmm, yeah
Alright
Ooh

[Verse 1]
Got a call from an old friend, we used to be real close
Said he couldn't go on the American way
Closed his shop, sold the house, bought a ticket to the west coast
Now he gives them a stand-up routine in L.A.​

[Chorus]
I don't need you to worry for me 'cause I'm alright
I don't want you to tell me it's time to come home
I don't care what you say anymore, this is my life
Go ahead with your own life, leave me alone

[Post-Chorus]
I never said you had to offer me a second chance
(I never said you had to...)
I never said I was a victim of circumstance
(I never said...)
I still belong (Still belong)
Don't get me wrong (Get me wrong)
And you can speak your mind
But not on my time


[Verse 2]
They will tell you you can't sleep alone in a strange place
Then they'll tell you you can't sleep with somebody else
Ah, but sooner or later, you sleep in your own space
Either way, it's okay, you wake up with yourself

[Chorus]
I don't need you to worry for me 'cause I'm alright
I don't want you to tell me it's time to come home

She cuts you once, she cuts you twice
But still you believe
The wound is so fresh
You can taste the blood
But you don't have strength to leave
You've been bought, you've been sold
You've been locked outside the door
But you stand there pleading
With your insides bleeding
Cause you deep down want some more

[Chorus]
When she says she wants forgiveness
It's such a clever masquerade
She's so good with her stiletto
You don't even see the blade
You don't even see the blade

[Verse 2]
She cuts you hard, she cuts you deep
She's got so much skill
She's so fascinating
That you're still there waiting
When she comes back for the kill
You've been slashed in the face
You've been left there to bleed
You want to run away
But you know you're gonna stay
Cause she gives you what you need


[Chorus]
Then she says she needs affection
While she searches for the vein
She's so good with her stiletto
You don't really mind the pain
You don't mind the pain
Oh

[Verse 3]
She cuts you out, she cuts you down
She carves up your life
But you won't do nothing
As she keeps on cutting
Cause you know you love the knife
You've been bought, you've been sold
You've been locked outside the door
But you stand there pleading
With your insides bleeding
'Cause you deep down want some more

While she searches for the vein

That says if I were to get in a car right now
North Carolina is where I would end
And to your doorstep I would be bound
To whisper the words that I've always wanted to say
And watch as the sun rips this blue sky away
Cause the colors are always changing
So stare up at the clouds
And at least you know
You're always looking up

So Casey can you remember
Sitting by my side
On the bank of the Delaware River
And talking about life

Don't forget about the blue skies, sunrise, and all the space between
It's amazing how a girl like you could affect a guy like me
All the pictures, memories and all the times we had
Do you think that some things are better left unsaid?

We'd stay inside just to watch the time go by
And sleep the whole day till the night
With everything you said
I'm sure you've got some place that you'd probably rather be
I hope you're singing this song
And thinking about me
Carolina was waiting for you
It's what you always wanted


Don't forget about the blue skies, sunrise, and all the space between
It's amazing how a girl like you could affect a guy like me
With the pictures, memories and all the times we had
Do you think that some things are better left unsaid?

And we run away
Cause the sky looks different when you're in another state
It's everything I've always wanted
And everything I've worked so hard for

Is it in me
To put the bottle down?
Well Is it in me?
To put the bottle down?
Well is it in me? (blue skies sunrise and all the space between)
To put the bottle down? (it's amazing how a girl like you could affect a guy like me)

You're getting distant
And now I'm the only one whose all alone

So let it all go just what you don't know is I'd pick you

So Break away from the simple things in life
Cause when the moon comes out
There is no doubt that it is always by your side
I never thought you could be so happy with a ticket in your hand
And a plane ride back to home
I guess for now I'll have to settle for the fact that what we could have been is what I'll never know

From the place you once called home
So much different

And I'm placing all our pictures
In these broken frames to remind me never fall in love again

I hope you realize you threw away the best thing that ever happened to you
Forget my name and forget my face hope you get on a plane and forget this place

Maybe now I'll figure out
That life is one big question how am I supposed to grow
When I'm stuck inside this state well I'll never know

(your body on)

Forget my name and forget my face hope you get on a plane and forget this place

And I never felt so high as my back is to the ground
And we're staring at the stars making faces at the clouds
But all those days are gone and the memories put to rest
And if you want to see my youth your gonna have to dig deep in my chest

I am walking her home
Making plans
With her shoes in her hands I am watching her dance
As the hem of her dress gently kisses the grass

It suddenly rains on us
She is laughing and turns up her hands
Like autumn turns leaves
Winter will breathe cold on our necks
Snow in our paths
Wherever she goes
All that I know about us is that beautiful things never last
That's why fireflies flash
When this summer time ends we will not part as friends
Things were promised in blood
We have sinned

Now there's tears in her eyes as she's screaming goodbyes
I run 'long side the car
Turning numb to the sound

I notice a chill in the air
September is creeping up fast


Like autumn turns leaves
Winter will breathe cold on our necks
Snow in our paths
Wherever she goes
All that I know about us is that beautiful things never last
That's why fireflies flash

Innocence didn't mean we're immune to these things
Let's blame the passage of time
Love and loss
Truth
It costs more than I can spare right now
Maybe it's simpler to lie

Like autumn turns leaves
Winter will breathe cold on our necks
Snow in our paths
Wherever she goes
All that I know about us is that beautiful things never last
That's why fireflies flash

Oh

So now you're thinkin' 'bout all you're missin' how
Deep you're sinkin', 'round and 'round and draggin' down
Why don't you cash in your chips, why don't you call it a loss
Not such a big loss, chalk it up to better luck

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Could've been true love, but it wasn't
It should all add up, but it doesn't


[Chorus]
There's your trouble, there's your trouble
You keep seein' double with the wrong one
You can't see I love you, you can't see she doesn't
But you just keep holdin' on
There's your trouble

[Pre-Chorus 3]
Should've all worked out, but it didn't
She should be here now, but she isn't

There's your trouble, there's your trouble

And you can't see I love you, you can't see she doesn't

Forgive? Sounds good
Forget? I'm not sure I could
They say time heals everything
But I'm still waiting

[Verse 2]
I'm through with doubt
There's nothin' left for me to figure out
I've paid a price
And I'll keep payin'

[Chorus]
I'm not ready to make nice
I'm not ready to back down
I'm still mad as hell and I don't have time
To go 'round and 'round and 'round
It's too late to make it right
I probably wouldn't if I could
'Cause I'm mad as hell, can't bring myself
To do what it is you think I should

[Verse 3]
I know you've said
""Can't you just get over it?""
It turned my whole world around
And I kinda like it


[Bridge]
I made my bed and I sleep like a baby
With no regrets and I don't mind sayin'
It's a sad, sad story when a mother will teach her
Daughter that she ought to hate a perfect stranger
And how in the world can the words that I said
Send somebody so over the edge
That they'd write me a letter, sayin' that I better
Shut up and sing or my life will be over

[Chorus]
I'm not ready to make nice
I'm not ready to back down
I'm still mad as hell and I don't have time
To go 'round and 'round and 'round
It's too late to make it right
I probably wouldn't if I could
'Cause I'm mad as hell, can't bring myself
To do what it is you think I should
I'm not ready to make nice
I'm not ready to back down
I'm still mad as hell and I don't have time
To go 'round and 'round and 'round
It's too late to make it right
I probably wouldn't if I could
'Cause I'm mad as hell, can't bring myself
To do what it is you think I should
What it is you think I should


[Outro]
Forgive, sounds good
Forget, I'm not sure I could
They say time heals everything
But I'm still waiting

It was one of those times what a real good time felt like a long time ago
It was one of those fires that burned all night and made your blue jeans smell like smoke
Hanging with friends, going against our upbringing, smokin' and drinkin'
It was one of those girls and one of those guys who didn't know quite what to do
We were going along with what was going on saying I think I love you
And I think about us now every time that I go out, smokin' and drinkin'

[Chorus]
Smokin' and drinkin' on the weekend like we did back in the day
Smokin' and drinkin' gotcha' thinkin about the one that got away
So here's to all those nights all we felt was life, smokin' and drinkin'

[Verse 2]
We be lighting up saying this town sucks so we painted on the bridge
We were young in love to not know enough that those were the days that we were going to miss
But damn we know it now cause that's all we talk about, smokin' and drinkin'

Quarter in a payphone
Drying laundry on the line
Watching Sun Tea in the window
Pocket watch tellin time
Seems like only yesterday I'd get a blank cassette
Record the country countdown cause I couldn't buy it yet
If we drove all the way to Dallas just to buy an Easter dress
We'd take along a Rand McNally, stand in line to pay for gas
God knows that shifting gears ain't what it used to be
I learned to drive that 55 just like a queen, three on a tree

[Chorus]
Hey, whatever happened to waitin' your turn
Doing it all by hand
Cause when everything is handed to you
It's only worth as much as the time put in
It all just seemed so good the way we had it
Back before everything became automatic

[Verse 2]
If you had something to say
You'd write it on a piece of paper
Then you'd put a stamp on it
And they'd get it three days later
Boys would call the girls
And girls would turn them down
Staying married was the only way to work your problems out

Until my sins wash away

Don't leave the smallest part
I've no need to live if you're to come up gone

And if and when I treat you wrong
No I never want to hurt our family

And I would give up everything
No this is not just about me
And I don't know a plainer way to say it Babe
And they may pay us off in fame
Though that is not why we came
And I know well and good that won't heal our hearts

We came for salvation
We came for family
We came for all that's good that's how we'll walk away
We came to break the bad
We came to cheer the sad
We came to leave behind the world a better way

Now if I'm walkin' through the rain
And I hear you call my name
I will break into a run without a pause
And if your love laughs at your dreams
Well it's not as bad as it seems
Either way one of them has got to go
And if you take of my soul
You can still leave it whole
With the pieces of you own you leave behind


We came for salvation
We came for family
We came for all that's good that's how we'll walk away
We came to break the bad
We came to cheer the sad
We came to leave behind the world a better way

And I would give up everything
And if you were to come up clean
And see you shine so bright in a world of woe
And they may pay us off in fame
But that is not why we came
And if it compromises truth then we will go

Whispering to your friends and watching me

I don't need to pack a bag

Any place, any time, any day of the week

I guess what I'm trying to say is
You make every day like a holiday
You make every day like a holiday

From any worries in the world
Baby, all of that can wait
Cause swaying to some music while I look in your eyes
It's pretty easy to see I'm in paradise

You make me wanna make a margarita

If I could touch your body

But I've got to think twice
Before I give my heart away
And I know all the games you play
Because I play them too

Oh but I need some time off from that emotion
Time to pick my heart up off the floor
Oh when that love comes down without devotion
Well it takes a strong man baby
But I'm showing you the door

So please, please, please don't go away
You say I'm giving you the blues
Maybe
You mean every word you say
Can't help but think of yesterday
And another who tied me down to loverboy rules


Before this river becomes an ocean
Before you throw my heart back on the floor
Oh baby I reconsider my foolish notion
Well I need someone to hold me
But I'll wait for something more

I gotta have faith

Counting down the seconds, standing in the wreckage of love
On a cold grey Jackson dawn
Oh I just can't watch this, sure can't stop this
I keep waiting, your tail lights are fading, I see
You're already gone
I'm half of who I used to be
One Mississippi, hm

I know I should wash it up But maybe I'll
Just wait here for a little while
I run my fingers around the top
Where your lips were I just stop 'cause I
I can almost see your smile
And it's one Mississippi, two Mississippi
Counting down the seconds, standing in the wreckage of love
On a cold grey Jackson dawn
And I know everybody's got their demons
Everybody's got their reasons
Why they leave when they run
But baby I could have helped you through it
You built a wall and I couldn't get to it
Now I'm waiting for the rain
And the pain to come yeah
And it's one Mississippi, two Mississippi

I'll kiss your lips again

My cellmate's​ a killer, they make me do push-ups in drag
But nobody cares if you're losing yourself
Am I losing myself?
Well, I miss my mom
Will they give me the chair?
Or lethal injection, or swing from a rope if you dare?
Ah, nobody knows
All the trouble I've seen

Nobody's ever taught ya how to live out on the street

Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat

Mama, listen

[Chorus 1: Justin Timberlake]
Señorita, I feel for you (Feel for you)

He doesn't love ya, I can tell by his charm (He don't love ya, baby)
But you could feel this real love (Feel it)

And I want the guys to sing with me
They go:
""It feels like somethin's heatin' up, can I leave with you?"" (Alright)
And then the ladies go:
""I don't know what I'm thinking 'bout, really leavin' with you""
Guys, sing:
It feels like somethin's heatin' up, can I leave with you?
And ladies:
""I don't know what I'm thinking 'bout, really leavin' with you""
Feels good, don't it? Come on

[Hook: Miss Platnum & Marteria]
Alle hab'n 'n Job, ich hab' Langeweile
Keiner hat mehr Bock auf Kiffen, Saufen, Feiern
So ist das hier im Block, tagein, tagaus
Halt' mir zwei Finger an den Kopf und mach': „Peng, peng, peng, peng“
Alle hab'n 'n Job, ich hab' Langeweile
Keiner hat mehr Bock auf Kiffen, Saufen, Feiern
So ist das hier im Block, tagein, tagaus
Halt' mir zwei Finger an den Kopf (Yeah) und mach': „Peng, peng, peng, peng“

[Part 1: Marteria, Marteria & Marsimoto]
Alle spiel'n jetzt Golf, jeder fährt Passat
Keiner tätowiert sich Wu-Tang aufn Arsch
Keiner tanzt mehr Moonwalk, seit Michael Jackson starb
Alle auf Salat, keiner mehr verstrahlt
Jeder macht Diät, niemand isst mehr Fleisch
Niemand hat 'n Trichter, alle saufen Wein
In der guten alten Zeit war'n alle donnerstags schon breit
Ich sitz' aufm Sofa, rauch' das ganze Zeug allein
Alle sind jetzt troy, niemand geht mehr raus
Keiner kämpft mehr bis zum Endboss, alle geben auf
Jeder geht jetzt joggen, redet über sein'n Bauch
Bevor die lila Wolken komm'n, sind alle längst zuhaus


[Hook: Miss Platnum]
Alle hab'n 'n Job, ich hab' Langeweile
Keiner hat mehr Bock auf Kiffen, Saufen, Feiern

[Part 2: Marteria]
Jeder glücklich Zweiter, keiner mehr Verlierer
Keiner geht mehr klau'n, freundlich zum Kassierer
Alle zieh'n aufs Land, in die große Stadt nie wieder
Silbernes Besteck, goldener Retriever
Alle mähen Rasen, putzen ihre Fenster
Jeder ist jetzt Zahnarzt, keiner ist mehr Gangster
Keiner fälscht mehr Stempel, alle gehen schwimm'n
Jeder steht jetzt auf der Liste, niemand geht mehr hin
Keiner will mehr ballern, treffen, um zu reden
Keiner macht mehr Malle, alle fahr'n nach Schweden (Skål!)
Jeder liebt die Bayern, vorm Essen beten
Leben kleine Träume, verbrenn'n die großen Pläne
[Hook: Miss Platnum]
Alle hab'n 'n Job, ich hab' Langeweile

[Bridge: Marteria & Yasha, Miss Platnum]
Randale und Krawall, die Zeiten sind längst vorbei
Wo sind meine Leute hin? Die war'n früher überall
Was all die andern starten, sieht wie 'ne Landung aus
Und die Welt, sie dreht sich weiter, nur nicht mehr ganz so laut
(Peng, peng, peng, peng)

Uh huh, uh, one thirteen nine seven nigga
A legend was made nigga, uh
Tune the fuck in, turn me up nigga
Lord forgive me for my sins, real shit

[Verse 1]
Out here gang bangin', I was born in the nineties
'Bout eleven, twelve, when I first decided
What the fuck I'ma claim, who the fuck I'ma ride with
Bitch I'm Eight Block for life so I got that shit tatted
T'd up on these niggas like the offensive lineman
Youngin clockin' out, I was putting that time in
Niggas steady hating 'cause they jumped in behind me
I said fuck it, get this money, I'ma kill 'em with kindness
Shit was adding up, now it's starting to minus
Used to shoot it out, it was easy to find us
Now we getting older, it's just homework and science
Before I come up out the crib I gotta peep through the blinds
Robbin jeans and my Nikes, in the 'jects shooting dice
Lil Deck to my left, Top Dawg to my right
Pull up to the light, double cup with some ice
Glock 17, if I don't up it quick as them, that's my life
In the hood where I'm from you go through shit you don't like
If your daddy was a rat then your ass is a mice
Go get your brother, get your cousin, niggas taking your bike
It's Jimmy Wop, he offed an opp, don't make me do this shit twice


[Chorus]
One, two, make me come up out that roof
Three, four, better watch that back door
Five, six, bitch we finna do a hit
Seven, eight, hundred shots in my AK
Nine, ten, you can't see behind the tint
Lord, forgive me for my sins
Lord, forgive me for my sins
Lord, forgive me for my sins

[Verse 2]
I got niggas throwing bricks for free
I got niggas doing hits for cheap
Make it thunder nigga, OKC
On McScary with my killers nigga, free KD
Used to be my friends now they my enemies
Since elementary knew I'll see penitentiaries
Been a bad lil nigga, no common sense for me
I ain't never had shit up under the Christmas tree
It's a mystery, Scooby Doo
Uzi made 'em do the hula hoop
Choppa make 'em chicken noodle soup
I got some hitters like to toot and boot
Rubber handle, fuck a wrestle, nigga no Farooq
Donkey Kong clips let that banana shoot
On my Pokémon shit, I let it peek at you
Spin blocks, spin back again, that shit like deja vu


[Chorus]
One, two, make me come up out that roof
Three, four, better watch that back door
Five, six, bitch we finna do a hit
Seven, eight, hundred shots in my AK
Nine, ten, you can't see behind the tint
Lord, forgive me for my sins
Lord, forgive me for my sins
Lord, forgive me for my sins"

Mamas, mamas, baby mamas' mamas
Yeah, go like this

I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologized a trillion times

My baby a drama mama don't like me
She be doin' things like havin' them boys
Come from her neighborhood to the studio, tryna fight me
She need to get a piece of the American pie and take her bite out
That's my house, I'll disconnect the cable and turn the lights out
And let her know her grandchild is a baby and not a pay check
Private school, daycare, shit, medical bills, I pay that
I love your mom and everything
But see, I ain't the only one who laid down
She wanna rib you up to start a custody war, my lawyers stay down
She never got a chance to hear my side of the story, we was divided
She had fish fries and cookouts for my child's birthday, I ain't invited
Despite it I show her the utmost respect when I fall through
All you, do is defend that lady when I call you, yeah


[Chorus: André 3000]
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real

Me and your daughter got a special thang goin' on (We got a special kinda thing)
You say it's puppy love, we say it's full-grown (Arroof)
Hope that we feel this, feel this way forever
You can plan a pretty picnic but you can't predict the weather
Ms. Jackson
[Verse 2: André 3000]
Ten times out of nine, now if I'm lyin', find
The quickest muzzle, throw it on my mouth and I'll decline
King meets queen, then the puppy love thing
Together dream 'bout that crib with the Goodyear swing
On the oak tree, I hope we feel like this forever
Forever, forever ever? Forever ever?
Forever never seems that long until you're grown
And notice that the day-by-day ruler can't be too wrong
Ms. Jackson, my intentions were good, I wish I could
Become a magician to abracadabra all the sadder
Thoughts of me, thoughts of she, thoughts of he
Asking what happened to the feeling that her and me had
I pray so much about it, need some knee pads
It happened for a reason, one can't be mad
So know this, know that everything's cool
And yes, I will be present on the first day of school and graduation


[Chorus: André 3000 & Big Boi]
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry

Never meant to make your daughter cry (Uh, uh, yeah)
I apologized a trillion times

""Look at the way he treats me"", shit, look at the way you treat me
You see, your little nosy-ass homegirls done got your ass sent up the creek, G
Without a paddle, you left to straddle and ride this thing on out (Out)
Now you and your girl ain't speakin' no more 'cause my dick all in her mouth (Mouth)
Know what I'm talkin' about?
Jealousy, infidelity, envy, cheating, beating in the year 2G, they be the same thing
So who you placin' the blame on? You keep on singin' the same song
Let bygones be bygones and you can go on and get the hell on, you and your mama

We were staying in Paris
To get away from your parents
And I thought, “Wow
If I could take this in a shot right now
I don't think that we could work this out”
Out on the terrace
I don't know if it's fair but I thought “How
Could I let you fall by yourself
While I'm wasted with someone else”

If we go down then we go down together
They'll say you could do anything
They'll say that I was clever

We'll get away with everything

(I say why bout that boy, are you still insecure?)
Likkle wastegyal want fi man out di slum
(Batty fine, dutty wine me a want see it done)
Me and Millz break the nine, come on boost it up a notch
Demeanour of a leader, even cooler than your socks
I would say the watch but the bitch that cold
Waitin' to exhale, but she wouldn't let go
Leanin' out the liter, I ain't gettin' strep throat
Flyer than the seagulls steady bumpin' Beanie Sigel
Disrespect it then we squeezin', I ain't gettin' stepped on
Khaza, he the sequel, if you didn't catch on
Ain't no latchin' on to my success
Breadwinners association, I move for the paper the haters consider a threat
Condo screenshotting my convo, I meant to say text
Disruptive behavior, subject to change by my chain, get upset
I'm becomin' a gangster, they have PMS
If you won't be a woman then go get a plumber and grow you some breasts
Rollin' up sleeves like a sink, spread the cabinet, layin' pipe underneath
Rap game kitchen counter, came to tighten up leaks
(Tell 'em what you mean)
Time to tighten up the leash


[Hook]
Niggas talkin' and that shit annoying
See I pay my dues, you can't afford it
Since I got them racks they can't ignore me
I keep it movin', fuck what's not important
Excuse me, it's a real nigga here with some money
Excuse me, it's a real nigga here with some money
Excuse me, niggas talkin' and that shit annoying
I keep it movin', fuck what's not important
Excuse me

[Verse 2]
Oh my God, I'm a God
Neighborhood, I'm a star
Sick of red bitches, they don't listen in the car
Girlfriend in my lap while I'm twistin' the cigar
Luca Brasi, I murder bout Mazi
Mucho the boss still livin' in my thoughts
I'm a real vic, money limp when I walk
Beat a bitch back in, big dick dinner soft
Big clip by the couch wearin' zips that's an out
Public housing, no authority and the clique got a house
Try to turn speaker off blip-blip with the AUX
Tuck somethin' close to you, eatin' grits witcha spouse
No bathrobe wearin' ass nigga
Breadwinner brick game hashtag emblem
Peace sign on the hood in Benz symbol
Still goin' off, make the clique get richer
Shots on her back and her chest to the pillow
Pieces come together, playin' chess with a picture
Dog just a pawn, I be fresh, get the picture?
Knuckles all scarred up, discoloration
Mental gymnastics with this conversation
Just my little friend, this was just a vacation
I'm dedicated to the grind, real nigga discipline
Show on the road, low pros and they Michelin


[Hook]
Niggas talkin' and that shit annoying
See I pay my dues, you can't afford it
Since I got them racks they can't ignore me
I keep it movin', fuck what's not important
Excuse me, it's a real nigga here with some money
Excuse me, it's a real nigga here with some money
Excuse me, niggas talkin' and that shit annoying
I keep it movin', fuck what's not important
Excuse me

Man there ain't no sense in playin' with these niggas man
Go in there and give 'em the business, flush him out
And we gon' turn up in this bitch tonight, hard for
Luca Brasi nigga

[Hook]
It's a few wrong ways and they don't make a right
You can do both ways, ignorin' wrong and the right
New boyfriend whom she don't seem to like
Stay right here, it's him your won't see tonight
Argumentative but say she want compromise
Women say they love but never more than the ice
Mistakin' it for trust, starin' right in the eyes
Women say they love but never more than the ice
You the only one that my dick could get hard for
I'm confused, what the fuck you want my heart for?
You the only one that my dick could get hard for
I've been misused, what the fuck you want my heart for?

[Bridge]
Can you even hear me?
I've been misused, what the fuck you want my heart for?

[Interlude]
Girl, but Kevin it's like you here but you ain't here though
Gates, what the fuck you mean I'm not here? I'm right here
Girl, you lookin' at me like you want another bitch to jump at my face
Gates, well maybe I do


[Verse 1]
Talkin' work on my phone nigga say he got them bricks
Scored a few by the two, or the ten, that's a lick
And my momma know I'm gutter and she also know I'm strapped
And she know I killed the key and Keith, ain't try to murder back
She know you take a shot at me, I'ma send like 30 back
Christina and Alicia, they both keep my dirty gat
Comprehend you talkin' reckless while we on my cellular
Life is too depressin' to be stressin' on the regular

[Hook]
It's a few wrong ways and they don't make a right
You can do both ways, ignorin' wrong and the right
New boyfriend whom she don't seem to like
Stay right here, you won't see the night
Argumentative but say she want compromise
Women say they love but never more than the ice
Mistakin' it for trust, starin' right in the eyes
Women say they love but never more than the ice
You the only one that my dick could get hard for
I'm confused, what the fuck you want my heart for?
You the only one that my dick could get hard for
I've been misused, what the fuck you want my heart for?

[Bridge]
Can you even hear me?
I've been misused, what the fuck you want my heart for?


[Verse 2]
I wanna stop hustlin', I wanna change over
Right now a nigga aim on that Range Rover
God forgive me for the brains I done blowed away
Put that on my unborn child and my throwaway
Commitment shy, I'm afraid of bein' involved
Shawty tell me she love me, I don't tell her I love her back
Niggas in the hood, I go see 'em when I can
I got niggas in jail, I go and see 'em in the can

[Hook]
It's a few wrong ways and they don't make a right

Hey, I've been wantin' to call ya, tell you that I'm sorry
Same old fucking story everybody sing

[Pre-Chorus: Kehlani]
And I say I'm okay, but I guess I'm a liar
You say you're okay, but I saw that you liked it

Know that's when you miss me, know that's when you cryin'

Gaze into her killing jar
I'd sometimes stare for hours
(Sometimes stare for hours)
She even poked the holes so I can breathe
She bought the last line, I'm just the worst kind
Of guy to argue with what you might find
And for the last night I lie
Could I lie with you?

[Chorus: Gerard Way]
Alright, give up, get down
It's just the hardest part of living
Alright, she wants it all
To come down this time

[Verse 2: Gerard Way]
I'm lost in the prescription
She's got something else in mind
(Something else in mind)
Check into the Hotel Bella Muerte
It gives the weak flight, it gives the blind sight
Until the cops come or by the last light
And for the last night I lie
Could I lie next to you?


[Chorus: Gerard Way]
Alright, give up, get down
It's just the hardest part of living
Alright, she wants it all

But I'd like to learn your name
When holding on
I hope you do the same, oh, sugar
Slip into the tragedy

Sister, I'm not much a poet, but a criminal
And you never had a chance
Love it or leave it, you can't understand
A pretty face, but you do so carry on
And on, and on
I wouldn't front the scene if you paid me
I'm just the way that the doctor made me
On, and on, and on, and on
Love is the red, the rose on your coffin door
What's life like bleeding on the floor, the floor, the floor?

[Pre-Chorus: Gerard Way]
You'll never make me leave
I wear this on my sleeve
Give me a reason to believe

[Chorus: Gerard Way]
So give me all your poison
And give me all your pills
And give me all your hopeless hearts
And make me ill
You're running after something that you'll never kill
If this is what you want, then fire at will

[Verse 2: Gerard Way]
Preach all you want, but who's gonna save me?
I keep a gun on the book you gave me
Hallelujah, lock and load
Black is the kiss, the touch of a serpent son
It ain't the mark or the scar that makes you one
And one, and one, and one

[Verse 1]
Wait until it fades to black, ride into the sunset
Would I lie to you? Well, I’ve got something to say
Grab your six-gun from your back, throttle the ignition
Would I die for you? Well, here's your answer in spades
Shotgun sinners, wild-eyed jokers, got you in my sights
Gun it while I’m holding on

[Verse 2]
After all is said and done, climb out from the pine box
Well, I’m asking you, 'cause she's got nothing to say
The angels just cut out her tongue, call her black Mariah
Would I lie to you? That girl's not right in the brain
Mass convulsions strike the choir by the grace of God
Gun it while I’m holding on

[Chorus]
But don't stop if I fall, and don't look back
Oh, baby, don't stop, bury me, and fade to black

Do you remember that day when we met?
You told me ""This gets harder,"" well, it did

Promise me that when I've gone, you'll kill my enemies

The damage you've inflicted, temporary wounds
I'm comin' back from the dead
And I'll take you home with me
I'm taking back a life you stole

We never got that far
This helps me to think all through the night

Just you and I, your starless eyes remain

Hip-hip-hooray for me, you talk to me
But would you kill me in my sleep? Lay still like the dead
From the razor to the rosary, we could lose ourselves
And paint these walls in pitchfork red

I will avenge my ghost with every breath I take
I'm comin' back (I'm comin' back from the dead) from the dead (I'm comin' back)
And I'll take you home with me

This hole you put me in wasn't deep enough
And I'm climbin' out right now
You're running out of places to hide from me

When you go, just know that I will remember you
If livin' was the hardest part, we'll then one day be together
And in the end, we'll fall apart
Just like the leaves changin' colors
And then I will be with you
I will be there one last time now
When you go, just know that I will remember you
I've lost my fear of falling
I will be with you, I will be with you"

And they found you on the bathroom floor

Singing songs that make you slit your wrists

So I won't stop dying, won't stop lying
If you want, I'll keep on crying

Is this what you always want me for?

A place for you and just you mind your manners when you go
And when you go, don't return to me, my love,"" that's right

""And if you would call me a sweetheart
I'd maybe then sing you a song""
But there's shit that I've done with this fuck of a gun
You would cry out your eyes all along


[Outro: Gerard Way]
We're damned after all
Through fortune and flame, we fall
And if you can stay, then I'll show you the way
To return from the ashes you call
We all carry on (We all carry on)
When our brothers in arms are gone (When our brothers in arms are gone)
So raise your glass high, for tomorrow, we die
And return from the ashes you call"

And walk away a savior
Or a madman and polluted
From gutter institutions
Don't you breathe for me
Undeserving of your sympathy
'Cause there ain't no way that I'm sorry for what I did

How could you cry for me?
'Cause I don't feel bad about it

Kiss me goodbye

Well, I was there on the day they sold the cause for the queen
And when the lights all went out, we watched our lives on the screen
I hate the ending myself, but it started with an alright scene

[Verse 1]
It was the roar of the crowd that gave me heartache to sing
It was a lie when they smiled and said, ""You won't feel a thing""
And as we ran from the cops, we laughed so hard, it would sting
Yeah, yeah, woah

[Pre-Chorus]
If I'm so wrong (So wrong, so wrong)
How can you listen all night long? (Night long, night long)
Now, will it matter after I'm gone?
Because you never learned a goddamn thing

[Chorus]
You're just a sad song with nothing to say
About a lifelong wait for a hospital stay
And if you think that I'm wrong
This never meant nothing to you

[Verse 2]
I spent my high school career spit on and shoved to agree
So I could watch all my heroes sell a car on TV
Bring out the old guillotine, we'll show 'em what we all mean
Yeah, yeah, woah

And where did you hide?
Go find another way

Transcending space and time
And I was rendered still
There were no words for me to find at all
As I stood there beside myself
I could see you and no one else

Changing you with the tide
And dawn's ribbon of light
Bursts through the dark
Wakening you inside
And I thought it was all untrue
Until there all at once I knew

Lean on me like a kickstand

That's no fuss

I cop it, you rock it
No hater can stop it

When your number square's spellin' bingo?

Ooh-oh
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
No-ooh

[Verse 1]
When you feel it in your body, you found somebody who
Makes you change your ways like hanging with your crew
Said you act like you ready, but you don't really know
And everything in your past, you wanna let it go

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been there, done it, humped around, ha
After all that, this is what I found
Nobody wants to be alone
If you're touched by the words in this song
Then maybe...

[Chorus]
(You) You got it, you got it bad
When you're on the phone (Oh, yeah), hang up and you call right back
(Oh, you) You got it, you got it bad
If you miss a day without your friend, your whole life's off-track
Know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house
You don't wanna have fun, it's all you think about
You got it bad when you're out with someone
But you keep on thinking 'bout somebody else
You got it bad


[Verse 2]
When you say that you love 'em and you really know
Everything that used to matter don't matter no more
Like my money, all my cars (You can have it all and)
Flowers, cards and candy (I do it just 'cause I'm)
Said I'm fortunate to have you, girl
I want you to know, I really adore you
All my people who know what's going on
Look at your mate, help me sing my song
Tell her, ""I'm your man, you're my girl
I'm gonna tell it to the whole wide world""
Ladies, say, ""I'm your girl, you're my man
Promise to love you the best I can""

[Pre-Chorus]
See, I've been there, done it, humped around
After all that, this is what I found
Everyone of y'all are just like me
It's too bad that you can't see
That you got it bad

[Chorus]
You got it, you got it bad (Hey, hey, no, no)
When you're on the phone, hang up and you call right back
You got it, ha, you got it bad
If you miss a day without your friend, your whole life's off track (Yeah)
Know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house (Oh, you're stuck)
You don't wanna have fun, it's all you think about (Look at yourself)
You got it bad when you're out with someone
But you keep on thinking 'bout somebody else (Somebody)
You got it bad


[Electric Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
You got it, you got it bad
When you're on the phone, hang up and you call right back
You got it, you got it bad
If you miss a day without your friend, your whole life's off track
Know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house
You don't wanna have fun, it's all you think about
You got it bad when you're out with someone
But you keep on thinking 'bout somebody else"

As if you'd even care
When the lights are up
And the sun had nearly gone down

Did you see him on the street?
Did you pass him at your feet?
Did you think at all, ""How dare they even look me in the eye""?

And he loves the girls
And he loves the boys
Going to make twenty dollars
Before the weekend's over

So set him up
To let him fall
Turn him over in your hands
God save the King of New Orleans

Got a ticket to a show
Going to see him take a blow
When the drunk one said
""Cat Stevens was the greatest singer!""

And did you kick him in the head?
Did you see the blood run down?
Did you laugh at all, when the people walked right by and said aloud
""Gutter punks are all the same""?
Probably make twenty dollars 'fore the weekend's over


So set him up
Then let him fall
Turn him over in your hands
God save the King of New Orleans
Set him up
Then let him fall
Turn him over in your hands
God save the King of New Orleans

Radio in my head
Radio in that car
Going down again
He's going down again

Anyway you look
Anyway you talk it over
It's easier
To let it slip out of your mind

But it rips your heart out
Then it kicks your head in
Just give him one more chance
Try to see the beauty in his world

All the way in on my hands in on my feet and shoulders
Going to make twenty dollars before the weekend's over


So set him up
Then let him fall
Turn him over in your hands
God save the King of New Orleans
Set him up
Then let him fall
Turn him over in your hands
God save the King of all New Orleans

God save the King of New Orleans"

[Verse 1]
And suckers be thinkin' that they can fake this
But I'ma drop it at a higher level
'Cause I'm inclined to stoop down, hand out some beatdowns
Could run a train on punk fools that think they run the game
But I learned to burn that bridge and delete
Those who compete at a level that's obsolete
Instead, I warm my hands upon the flames of the flag
To recall the downfall and the businesses that burnt us all
See through the news and the views that twist reality
Enough, I call the bluff, fuck Manifest Destiny
Landlords and power whores, on my people, they took turns
Dispute the suits, I ignite and then watch 'em burn

No shelter if you're looking for shade

Was it cast for the mass who burn and toil?
Or for the vultures who thirst for blood and oil?
Yes a spectacle, monopolized

Who stuff the banks, who staff the party ranks
More for Gore or the son of a drug lord

Deep inside of a parallel universe
It's getting harder and harder to tell what came first, um
Underwater where thoughts can breathe easily
Far away you were made in a sea, just like me

[Chorus]
Christ, I'm a sidewinder, I'm a California King
I swear it's everywhere, oh, it's everything

[Verse 2]
Staring straight up into the sky, oh, my, my
A solar system that fits in your eye, microcosm
You could die but you're never dead, spider web
Take a look at the stars in your head, fields of space kid

[Chorus]
Christ, I'm a sidewinder, I'm a California King
I swear it's everywhere, oh, it's everything
Christ, I'm a sidewinder, I'm a California King
I swear it's everywhere, oh, it's everything

Psychic changes are born in your heart, entertain
A nervous breakthrough that makes us the same, bless your heart, girl
Kill the pressure it's raining on salty cheeks
When you hear the beloved song, I am with you

(Crank the music up)
Bring that shit in, uh!
Yeah, the movement's in motion with massive militant poetry
Now check this out, uh!

[Verse 1]
In the right light, study becomes insight
But the system that dissed us, teaches us to read and write
So-called facts are fraud
They want us to allege and pledge and bow down to their god
Lost the culture, the culture lost
Spun our minds and through time, ignorance has taken over
Yo, we gotta take the power back
Bam, here's the plan
Motherfuck Uncle Sam, step back, I know who I am
Raise up your ear, I'll drop the style and clear
It's the beats and the lyrics they fear
The rage is relentless
We need a movement with a quickness
You are the witness of change and to counteract
We gotta take the power back

[Chorus]
Yeah, we gotta take the power back
Come on, come on!
Yeah, we gotta take the power back


[Verse 2]
The present curriculum, I put my fist in 'em
Eurocentric, every last one of 'em
See right through the red, white, and blue disguise
With lecture I puncture the structure of lies
Installed in our minds and attempting to hold us back
We've got to take it back
Holes in our spirit causing tears and fears
One-sided stories for years and years and years
I'm inferior? Who's inferior?
Yeah, we need to check the interior
Of the system who cares about only one culture
And that, is why we gotta take the power back

[Chorus]
Yeah, we gotta take the power back
Come on, come on!
Yeah, we gotta take the power back

[Bridge]
Ayo check, we're gonna have to break it
Break it, break it down
Aw shit

[Instrumental Break]
Uh!
And like this
Uh! Come on
Yeah, bring it back the other way
Uh!


[Verse 3]
The teacher stands in front of the class
But the lesson plan he can't recall
The student's eyes don't perceive the lies
Bouncing off every fucking wall
His composure is well kept
I guess he fears playing the fool
The complacent students sit
And listen to that bullshit that he'd learned in school
Europe ain't my rope to swing on
Can't learn a thing from it, yet we hang from it
(Gotta get it, gotta get it together then
Like the motherfuckin' weathermen)
Expose and close the doors on those who try
To strangle and mangle the truth
'Cause the circle of hatred continues unless we react
We gotta take the power back

[Chorus]
Yeah, we gotta take the power back
Come on, come on!
Yeah, we gotta take the power back

[Bridge]
No more lies
No more lies
No more lies
No more lies
No more lies

I watch the birds of prey that hunt the canyon below my house
They're lookin' for a meal like a lizard or a mouse
I wonder if they appreciate the setting like me
To control your own direction, choose to be free, and
I reserve the right to be as trite as I want
And you can lick but don't bite I toss you here to Vermont
I kick it lickity split and hand it to the man in the tan van
And, and as for you and your crew, I don't hate you

[Pre-Chorus 2: Nick Hexum]
Peace is my priority 'cause Marley said for sure-ity
And what do you think I'm doin'? I'm not only here for screwin'
Yo and if it's sore, take care of it, perhaps from too much stucking
But anytime you're aware of it then keep on fucking

[Verse 3: Doug ""SA"" Martinez with Nick Hexum]
To be the one who has it all is not that hard
And I'll be that type of dude in a funky car
I dream of a suit that'll fit my rhyme
When I recognize my girl from a former life
I love it when the only sound that I hear is your infectious laughter
I will hear you again in eight hundred years if I'm still lucky

[Pre-Chorus 3: Nick Hexum]
Go north on outpost then take a left on Mullholland
To me that's where I like it and Macapa Drive is callin'

[Outro: Nick Hexum, Doug ""SA"" Martinez, Both]
I break a silly peace for offering, rap weasel then I'm boffering
I'd give you an exclusive on my playlist

That's why most radio will never play this, tell 'em again, uh

Sick as a porno flick yet gold as precious laughter (Uh)
Many don't agree but we can't care about that

How Jesus the Saviour did come for to die
For poor on'ry people like you and like I;
When Mary birthed Jesus 'twas in a cow's stall
With wise men and farmers and shepherds and all
But high from God's heaven, a star's light did fall
And the promise of ages it then did recall
If Jesus had wanted for any wee thing
A star in the sky or a bird on the wing
Or all of God's Angels in heaven to sing
He surely could have it, 'cause he was the King"

[Verse 1: Q-Tip & Ali Shaheed Muhammad]
People, give your ears, so I be sublime
It's enjoyable to know you and the concubines
Niggas, take off your coats, ladies, act like gems
Sit down Indian style as we recite these hymns
See, lyrically I'm Mario Andretti on the MOMO
Ludicrously speedy or infectious with the slow-mo
Heard me in the '80s, J.B.s on ""The Promo""
In my never-endin' quest to get the paper on the caper
But now, let me take it to the Queens side
I'm takin' it to Brooklyn side
All the residential Questers who invade the air
Hold up a second, son, 'cause we almost there
You can be a Black man and lose all your soul
You can be white and groove, but don't crap the roll
See my shit is universal if you got knowledge of dolo
Or delf or self, see there's no one else
Who can drop it on the angle, acute at that
So who that, do that, do-do that, that, that (Come on)
Who that, do that, do-do that, that, that (Yeah, okay)
Do that, do that, do-do that, that, that
I'm buggin' out, but let me get back, 'cause I'm wettin' niggas
So run and tell the others, 'cause we are the brothers
I learned how to build mics in my workshop class
So give me this award and let's not make it the last

[Verse 2: Phife Dawg]
Back in '89, I simply slid into place
Buddy, buddy, buddy all up in your face
A lot of kids was bustin' rhymes, but they had no taste
Some said Quest was wack, but now is that the case?
I have a quest to have a mic in my hand
Without that, it's like Kryptonite and Superman
So, Shaheed, come in with the sugar cuts
Phife Dawg's my name, but on stage call me Dynomutt
When was the last time you heard the Phifer sloppy?
Lyrics anonymous, you'll never hear me copy
Top notch, baby, never comin' less
Sky's the limit, you gots to believe up in Quest
Sit back, relax, get up out the path
If not that, here's a dance floor, come move that ass
Non-believers, you can check the stats
I roll with Shaheed and the brother Abstract
Niggas know the time when Quest is in the jam
I never let a statue tell me how nice I am
Comin' with more hits than the Braves and the Yankees
Livin' mad phat like an oversized mampi
The wackest crews try to diss, it makes me laugh
When my track record's longer than a DC-20 aircraft
So next time that you think you want somethin' here
Make somethin' def or take that garbage to St. Elsewhere

It was two weeks after the day she turned eighteen
All dressed in white, goin' to the church that night
She had his box of letters in the passenger seat
Sixpence in a shoe, somethin' borrowed, somethin' blue

[Pre-Chorus]
And when the church doors opened up wide
She put her veil down, tryin' to hide the tears
Oh, she just couldn't believe it
She heard the trumpets from the military band
And the flowers fell out of her hands

[Chorus]
Baby, why'd you leave me? Why'd you have to go?
I was countin' on forever, now I'll never know
I can't even breathe
It's like I'm lookin' from a distance, standin' in the background
Everybody's sayin' he's not comin' home now
This can't be happenin' to me
This is just a dream

[Verse 2]
The preacher man said, ""Let us bow our heads and pray
Lord, please lift his soul and heal this hurt""
Then the congregation all stood up and sang
The saddest song that she ever heard
[Pre-Chorus]
And then they handed her a folded-up flag
And she held on to all she had left of him
Oh, and what could have been
And then the guns rang one last shot
And it felt like a bullet in her heart

[Chorus]
Baby, why'd you leave me? Why'd you have to go?
I was countin' on forever, now I'll never know
I can't even breathe
It's like I'm lookin' from a distance, standin' in the background
Everybody's sayin' he's not comin' home now
This can't be happenin' to me
This is just a dream

[Bridge]
Ooh, baby, why'd you leave me? Why'd you have to go?
I was countin' on forever
Now I'll never know
Oh, I'll never know

Jenny grew up wild, like a blackfoot daisy
Out in the shack with a blue tick hound
Broke as hell, but blessed with beauty
The kind that a rich man can't turn down
She caught the eye of an oil man dancing
One summer night in a dime store dress
She had the looks, he had the mansion
And you can figure out the rest

[Pre-Chorus]
It was all roses, drippin' in diamonds
Sippin' on champagne
She was all uptown, wearing that white gown
Takin' his last name

[Chorus]
She could hear those church bells ringin', ringin'
And up in the loft, that whole choir singin', singin'
Fold your hands and close your eyes
Yeah, it's all gonna be alright
And just listen to the church bells ringin', ringin'
Yeah, they're ringin'

[Verse 2]
Jenny was hosting Junior League parties
And havin' dinner at the country club
Everyone thought they were Ken and Barbie
But Ken was always gettin' way too drunk
Saturday night, after a few too many
He came home ready to fight
And all his money could never save Jenny
From the devil livin' in his eyes


[Pre-Chorus 2]
It was all bruises, covered in makeup
Dark sunglasses
And that next morning, sitting in the back pew
Praying with the baptist

[Chorus]
She could hear those church bells ringin', ringin'
And up in the loft, that whole choir singin', singin'
Fold your hands and close your eyes
Yeah, it's all gonna be alright
You just listen to the church bells ringin', ringin'
Yeah, they're ringin'

[Verse 3]
Jenny slipped somethin' in his Tennessee whiskey
No law man was ever gonna find
And how he died is still a mystery
But he hit a woman for the very last time

[Chorus]
She could hear those church bells ringin', ringin'
Standin' there in a black dress singin', singin'
Fold your hands and close your eyes
Yeah, it's all gonna be alright
And just listen to the church bells ringin', ringin'
Yeah, they're ringin'"

Midnight's creepin' in, we know better
Than leaving here together
And in case you were wondering
You've never looked hotter
So why even bother
Looking at the reasons not to
Maybe we ought to

And get you out of this bar
Out of that dress
And kiss a little more
And kiss a little more

When your friends start asking you
Look 'em in the eyes
Tell a white lie
How I dropped you off at home
And I walked you to the door
Nothing more
Tomorrow you can say we're just friends
But baby ‘til then
Kiss a little more

Kiss a little more
Think a little less
Burning up the night like a cigarette
And get you out of this bar
Out of that dress
And kiss a little more

Give you a minute or two
To say goodbye to your friends
Ain't gotta go home
But we gotta get gone
Cause we've already waited way too long to...

Think a little less
And do the only thing we've been thinking ‘bout doing

Well, I woke up in places that I couldn't remember
Who's lyin' next to me or even how I got there
And that's hard to believe but that's how I used to roll

One Tuesday night, in an underground pool hall
That's where I saw her for the first time, right around last call
She stole my heart and I started walkin' down a new road

[Chorus]
And, oh, when I'm holdin' her
It's like peace on Earth
Where time stands still
And love's the only thing, yeah, that I feel
When she's in my arms
No matter where we are
Well, I am right at home
When I'm holdin' her

[Verse 3]
Now, on a park bench down on 4th Street, that's where I popped the question
And to my amazement, she actually said yes
Tears filled my eyes as I slipped a ring on her hand

[Verse 4]
Oh, then a few short years later God put into my world
A 6 pound and 8 ounce sweet baby girl
And ever since that day, let me tell you now, I became a brand new man


[Chorus]
Because when I'm holdin' her
It's like peace on Earth
Where time stands still
And love's the only thing, yeah, that I feel

That lipstick on your collar, well, it ain't my shade of pink

And there's a little wine stain on the pocket of your white cotton thread
Well, you drink beer and whiskey, boy, and you know I don't drink red

If the neighbors get to asking, I won't cover nothin' up

And sweaty palms from hanging on too tight
Clenched shut jaw
I've got another headache again tonight
Eyes on fire, eyes on fire
And they burn from all the tears
I've been crying, I've been crying
I've been dying over you
Tie a knot in the rope
Tryna hold, tryna to hold
But there's nothing to grab
So I let go

I think I maybe think too much
I think this might be it for us
Blow me one last kiss
You think I'm just too serious
I think you're full of shit

Blow me one last kiss
Just when it can't get worse

I want back my ignorance and bliss
I think I've had enough of this
Blow me one last kiss

I won't miss
All of the fighting that we always did
Take it in
I mean what I say when I say there is nothing left
No more sick Whiskey dick
No more battles for me
You'll be calling a trick
'Cause you no longer sleep
I'll dress nice, I'll look good
I'll go dancing alone
I will laugh, I'll get drunk
I'll take somebody home

Face the fact, there's always niggas out there, tryin' to knock the (Hustle)

I'm just a kettle from the ghetto with no pot to piss in
So who am I to call it black? Black man, black male
Black ball, black opsy, black diamonds glistenin' (Yeah)
Attract the pigs and all the rats, kitten scratch
I went from roaches on my bump to red brooches on the cuff
Of my tux, chauffeur pullin' up, no if, and's​ or buts about him
I went to Paris for my trunks, 100 thousand spent on Goyard
Used 'em once, couldn't give a shit, damn or fuck about 'em
Hit Canal Street, vintage gold medallion
Smokin' blunts in front of public housin'
Wildin' 'til they throw me in them cuffs
Mouth full of fronts, look like Master P up in my Cartiers (Uh)
Diamonds shinin' in the frames
Changed the game and made them say (Uh)
Ain't no limits to this shit, life's a flick, you're stickin' to the script

Take a pic', be sure to frame the shit, forever me, was always G

Uh, takin' meetings on my bus, this shit my mobile office
Gettin' head while at my desk, this shit my oval office

Now the sum of my performances just put me on the Forbes list

While you're waiting for that sound

You're stealin' from the lost and found
And what you find
Ain't what you had in mind
Until you find your Rolex in the sand

Until that solid gold is in your hand
You won't be happy

Say you won't be coming home

I want you by my lonesome, above this crowded space
It's easier to hold some, when no one's in the way
Well, if no one's in the running for the part
I'd love to pick a day
To show you the main room (Whenever's a good time)
I don't need a bouquet, I just need proper space
Homie three blocks away, I got bottles for days
I got tropical haze, go ahead and wave bye
Let me help with your coat, grab a hold of my arm
Tell them niggas to move, tell your sister you fine

As crazy as it may seem, it's not too hard to read
It's too many ifs and maybes, and not enough certainty
Well, if no one's putting numbers on the board
I'd love to take a swing, might even graze you
But I don't mean any harm, I'm just speaking my mind
Take a look at that moon, 'bout as bright as your eyes
We got plenty of space, go ahead and recline
Take a puff of that, get a sip of this wine

She had a bright smile, big white teeth, I mean
Whiter than her white T, remind me of wifey
Met her at the studio, sort of like a high buyer
She told me she had game so we connected like the wifi
She had this Asian swagger ‘bout her, so I call her mai tai
Started followin' her, she was the only thing on my timeline
And there was this one picture, her in the swimsuit
That made a nigga want to beat it up, and I intend to
But I'ma have to put in work, baby girl, then drink it all
Face like Mona Lisa, I'm just tryna be the wall to hang on
I ain't got no patience, I can't wait long
She come and see me, but she don't stay long
And that's the problem, she a good girl
Maybe it's too much smoke in the room
And she don't want that Mary Jane in her Vidal Sassoon
So I'ma take a minute, and walk her to her Uber
Got a bullet in my heart, and she the shooter
Ay, .Paak

I tried to drink it away
I tried to put one in the air
I tried to dance it away
I tried to change it with my hair

[Verse 2]
I ran my credit card bill up
Thought a new dress would make it better
I tried to work it away
But that just made me even sadder

[Verse 3]
I tried to keep myself busy
I ran around in circles
Think I made myself dizzy
I slept it away, I sexed it away
I read it away
Away

[Refrain]
Away, away, away, away, away
Away, away, away, away, away

Well, it's like cranes in the sky
Sometimes, I don't wanna feel those metal clouds

I tried to run it away
Thought then my head'd be feeling clearer
I traveled seventy states
Thought moving 'round'd make me feel better

[Verse 5]
I tried to let go my lover
Thought if I was alone then maybe I could recover
To write it away or cry it away (Don't you cry, baby)
Away

After you work, make sure that you play
Cuz too much of one leaves you all on your own
We determine our worth, with pleasure and pain
Keep fighting the thorn piercing flesh through the bone
I wish it would go, I wish it would stay
I wish that tomorrow was already told
I live on this earth, not knowing my fate
Entrusting the Lord with my heart and my soul
Counting my days, caught in this maze
Giving up praise for this ride 'til it's over
Feet on the ground, I reach for the stars
Dodging the darts that seem to come my way
Now I'm playing this game, I'm hating the score
I think I'm in love, and I look back and forth
I guess I'll wait to find out what glory looks like (yuh)

[Verse 2]
Swag is just overrated
Sliding in my lane and I'm kicking the door down
Swimming up the river I know that I can't drown
I'm tryna do too much as a man
Plus it ain't good in my home town
High thoughts bringing the saints low
And bright lights turn into faint glows
So ima let the wind blow
I ain't gonna chase it though, this is my intro
Tell you how the story go (yuh)

Once upon a time the people pleaser in me would hold back
'Til God said this message is much bigger than rap
Been happening for years, we've seen it across the map
The boomerang flow, me and Tom just brought it back
Preaching at people with no love
Stay looking at sinners with cold shrugs
The like minded get met with warm hugs
Welcome to the circus, it's all good on the surface
If you don't agree then throw a stone
All our houses made out of glass, i'm going home
Thinking who's who it's the attack of the clones
I'm at the final table when cards is being shown
Gotta keep my hands folded
Throw the deuces in, I can't hold em
Schools out, we tired of being scolded
We know the rules, just hate the way that you told 'em

And I already know i'm not untouchable

Watch it on my cell, they beating the same drum
Over crowded cells, in chains they can't run
It's 50 years later, where the change coming from

But when a man wants a man then he's on the shelf
She say she feel like a man and just wants some help
I guess it's easier to love em when it's someone else
So I apologize for the Paul disguise
We been wearing without solving the Saul inside
We don't mean no harm, we here to harmonize
Sound the alarm, it's time to cross the line

Neo sparring with Morpheus, look where I bleed
Stings like a bee, I ain't their Ali
People funnel the cake, the only fair I see
One for the money, two for the show
I do it for free if my grass will still grow
If I don't do it for three then who do I do it for (four)

Wondering what I'm made of
Everyday that I wake up, I'm feeling less cushion

Standing at the edge, staring at the ground
Tryna keep my focus, it's a long way down
